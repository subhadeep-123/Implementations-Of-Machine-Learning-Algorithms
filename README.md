 <h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
 Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a 
 specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial 
 intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make 
 predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
