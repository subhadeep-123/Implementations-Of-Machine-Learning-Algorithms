 <h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
 Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a 
 specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial 
 intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make 
 predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

<li><h2>What is Supervised learning?</h2></li>
 Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples

<li><h2>What is unsupervised learning?</h2></li>
Unsupervised learning is a term used for Hebbian learning, associated to learning without a teacher, also known as self-organization and a method of modeling the probability density of inputs. The cluster analysis as a branch of machine learning that groups the data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, cluster analysis identifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.
